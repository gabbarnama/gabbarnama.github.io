Money! Money is more than just currency - it's a reflection of the value we exchange for new ideas. Every successful business has an underlying business model that drives its products or services. Whether you’re flying from Las Vegas to Los Angeles or streaming the latest hit show on Netflix, you’re engaging with a business model that has evolved through innovation.
<!--more-->
We often notice patterns in how ideas originate and spread. Ideas can be big or small. Big ideas are rare, while small ideas emerge and fade more frequently. However, the size of an idea doesn’t determine its adoption. What really matters is how easy and intuitive it is to accomplish a task using that idea, compared to existing alternatives.

### Radical, Disruptive, and Incremental Innovation
Disruptive innovation is defined by how radically new ideas challenge the status quo. A common industry rule of thumb is that a new product must be 10x better than existing alternatives to change user behavior [1](#the-10x-rule). The 10x rule ensures the superior product rises to the top. Semiconductors replaced transistors, email overtook physical mail, mobile phones displaced landlines, and small computers gained dominance over their predecessors. This is a classic example of disruptive innovation, where new technologies displace established ones by offering better experiences.

However, as with any free market, competition soon follows, and the first-mover advantage is often short-lived. Not every new entrant can be 10x better than the competition—many are just marginally improved versions, representing incremental innovations.

While you can’t completely avoid competition, you can make the market less appealing to new entrants by innovating rapidly, offering a unique value proposition that’s hard to imitate, securing control over critical resources through vertical integration, or playing the cost game by leveraging scale once product-market fit has been achieved [2](#product-market-fit). This strategy can help you establish a dominant position (_monopoly_).

Then, there’s a third category of ideas—those that failed the 10x rule initially and were discontinued due to poor demand, but later became successful. These ideas are often ahead of their time, stymied by technological limitations or societal factors that hinder mass adoption [3](#technology-adoption-curve). For example, virtual reality was explored in the 1990s, but early headsets were bulky, expensive, and lacked sufficient content. Today, thanks to advances in display technology, processing power, and content creation, virtual reality has become more accessible and immersive, with applications in gaming, entertainment, education, and even therapy. Similarly, the cloud computing and Software as a Service (SaaS) models were attempted several times before virtualization technology made them feasible and successful. These are examples of radical innovation, where new technologies create entirely new markets.

### Innovators and Late Entrants

> To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.
<cite>Steve Jobs </cite>

When considering the product strategies of organizations, there are generally three approaches:
1. Innovate and leverage first-mover advantage to capture market share
2. Wait until the idea is proven and use market learnings to leapfrog to the end result in the same market
3. Copy the winning product and introduce it in an isolated market (low price preference, geographical or language separation)

There is a constant tug-of-war among the strategists over which approach is better. Purists favour genius innovators who take the risks, educate market and extend the frontier of innovation with the new knowledge [4](https://evolutionarytree.com/insight/opportunity-found-innovation-frontier). The first two categories differ from the third as the third excels in markets where barrier of entry (copyrights, scale etc.) are minimal and price discount trumps brand premium (intangible / promise of consistent value). 
First-mover advantage works best in markets with slow growth and limited technological change. This is particularly evident in the context of ERP software, where standardised operations and high switching costs (*lock-in* effects) favour early entrants. However, late movers can thrive in markets with slow evolution and rapid technological advancements. A prime example is Jio, an Indian telecom operator that successfully leapfrogged to 4G technology as smartphone penetration increased, while competitors were still struggling with older 2G and 3G standards.

> Vision without implementation is just hallucination.
<cite>Thomas Edison</cite>

In most other scenarios, agile players with substantial financial resources are better positioned to capture market share. Deep learning, exemplified by ChatGPT from OpenAI, is a recent example of a technology that has rapidly evolved, requiring agile players with deep pockets to remain competitive. Other examples include the ride-hailing industry, where companies like Uber and Lyft disrupted established taxi markets through technological innovation and aggressive marketing. Additionally, the streaming video market, dominated by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, demonstrates the importance of agility and financial resources in rapidly evolving industries.

Yesterday's first movers may have become today's late movers. Corporate divisions, silos of responsibility and decision-making can lead to this. Microsoft had to reinvent itself after Satya Nadella took over to become more agile and bring products to market faster.

There is a third category, the *copiers*, which take the key aspects of the winner's ideas and processes and then enter a new market as a first mover or compete on price in existing markets. 

#### _Copiers_ can have differentiation
It's not that _copiers_ are unsuccessful or are not able to make money. Instagram, which copied excessively from other applications and is immensely profitable.

To understand the reason for the success of these companies, I use the framework of the earth's layers to draw the comparison. These companies share a structural advantage similar to the earth's layered structure. At their core is a strong foundation defined by their mission and vision. This core purpose provides the 'why' that drives innovation. 

Built on this foundation is the tangible product or service offering, the 'what' and 'how' that delivers value. For all the successful companies, all the inspiration and copying happens at this level. 

Finally, effective communication acts as a bridge between the company and its customers, clearly articulating the value proposition and ensuring long-term success. This layered approach ensures that innovation is rooted in a strong purpose, delivered through a compelling product and effectively communicated to the market.

</figure>

If these foundational elements aren't properly layered, it’s unlikely that any company—whether an incumbent or a disruptor-will achieve market dominance. It’s essential to start with the ‘why’-the core mission and vision-and then build outwards, ensuring that the product and communication strategy align with this fundamental purpose.

Naspers (now Prosus) is a prime example of this approach. The company became famous for incubating startups that replicated the successful business models of U.S. unicorns in the developing world and Europe. Their first major investment in Tencent—which was inspired by ICQ—eventually created its own niche by introducing innovative services like WeChat in China.

It’s easy to argue that the Chinese economy’s controls and Internet restrictions helped Tencent succeed. But if you look at other companies, such as Rocket Internet (with ventures like Jabong, Zalando, DeliveryHero, and HelloFresh) in Europe, Ola in India, Jumia in Africa, Careem in the Middle East, Grab in Southeast Asia, and Panasonic in Japan, there’s something these organizations share that U.S. incumbents can’t match.

In addition to initial local pushes, the success of these companies is often driven by three factors:
1. A good enough product at a significantly lower price (total cost of ownership)
2. Feature differentiation based on local and regional needs
3. A centralized, fast decision-making structure that enables agility

#### Being a Copier and Still Innovating
As a Product Manager, you're often tasked with refining and iterating on existing features rather than creating something entirely new. This doesn't mean you're not innovating-it means you're engaging in incremental innovation. Even small changes, whether improving usability, speeding up a process, or enhancing customer support features can make a significant impact. These improvements can lead to better user retention, reduced churn, and more meaningful long-term success.... The key here is shifting the mindset from being a mere "feature executor" to embracing the idea of incremental innovation. Even if you're working in an environment that feels like a feature factory, you're still contributing to the evolution of the product and the business. Innovation doesn't always have to be groundbreaking; sometimes, it’s about small, continuous improvements that make a huge difference over time.

By adopting an incremental innovation mindset, you're not just executing features—you're building expertise, gaining insights, and contributing to the product's ongoing evolution. Even within a feature factory, you can find ways to innovate by optimizing existing processes, collaborating across teams, and ensuring that each new feature is carefully aligned with user needs and market trends.

Here are some ways to frame this shift:
1. **Focus on Small Wins:** Even when you’re not creating a completely new feature or business model, focus on improving existing features to make them better, faster, or more user-friendly. These small wins are often what customers remember most
2. **Customer-Centric Iteration:** You don't need to reinvent the wheel. By listening to customer feedback and analyzing user behavior, you can identify subtle yet impactful changes that improve the overall experience. Iterating based on real user data helps you stay relevant and make incremental changes that lead to long-term success
3. **Operational Innovation:** Often, it's not about the product itself but how you deliver it. Finding ways to streamline operations, improve team workflows, or reduce costs can have a significant impact. These are often less glamorous but equally vital forms of innovation that can propel a company forward
4. **Sustaining Innovation:** Just because you're not radically changing the business model doesn't mean you're not innovating. Sustaining innovation—improving upon the existing model—is just as important for staying competitive in the long run.

By adopting this approach, you can feel less like you're "just copying" and more like you're an integral part of an ongoing **evolution**. Even within a feature factory, you're still shaping the product, learning, and growing your skills as a PM.

**Philips vs. Panasonic**  
Take Philips and Panasonic, two giants in consumer electronics, for example. While Philips often pioneered cutting-edge technologies, Panasonic, a relative latecomer, focused on adapting quickly and offering cost-effective solutions. Over time, Panasonic leveraged its ability to innovate operationally and commercially, achieving success despite entering the market after Philips.

**Boeing vs. Airbus**  
In the world of commercial aviation, Boeing and Airbus have been in a decades-long duopoly. While Boeing has long been known for its innovations, Airbus, initially a newcomer, found success by disrupting the market with strategic pricing, technological improvements, and highly efficient manufacturing processes.

**Sabre vs. Amadeus**  
In travel technology, Sabre and Amadeus—two leading global distribution systems (GDS)-have revolutionized the industry. Sabre was initially dominated by American Airlines, but a group of European airlines dissatisfied with the lack of competition came together to form Amadeus, which was able to challenge Sabre's monopoly.

**Zomato vs. Swiggy**  
In the Indian food delivery market, Zomato and Swiggy are constantly battling for market share. While Zomato is known for introducing innovative features and services, Swiggy has excelled through strong local partnerships and a highly efficient delivery network. Their rivalry demonstrates how companies, even when copying each other's strategies, can differentiate themselves based on execution and local market knowledge.

These examples show that even as a "copier," a company can still innovate by focusing on specific aspects like **cost-effectiveness**, **feature differentiation**, or **operational efficiency**. By deeply understanding the market’s needs, analyzing competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, and executing quickly and efficiently, a company can carve out a unique position and achieve long-term success.

### The 10x Rule
#The-10x-Rule
Simply put, the new (and supposedly improved) idea, product or service will only be accepted by the masses if it is "10x better" than the competition. The improvement has to be on at least one dimension of speed, functionality, cost-effectiveness or user experience that makes the product better than the alternative without being worse on the others. The gap would ensure that once someone experiences your product, they cannot go back to the original.... The idea can be traced back to Bill Gross, an Internet entrepreneur of the 1990s who founded successful startups such as GoTo.com (Overture, which Yahoo! bought for $1.63 billion in 2003) and others. 

The insight is simple, but when taken literally it often leads to disastrous results. The improvement must be in an existing gap between the alternatives. For example, the Ford car won because it was 10x better than a horse-drawn cart in terms of ease of use and reliability. Would a 10x better horse-drawn cart have beaten the car? Google succeeded because it was at least 10x better than the others in ranking the search results with their PageRank algorithm. Uber grew because it made cab hailing 10x than the existing cabs services.

### Product-Market Fit
#Product-Market-Fit
The term product/market fit was coined by Sequoia Capital founder Don Valentine, formalised by Andy Rachleff and later popularised by Mark Andreessen of a16z. "*Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.*" Product-Market Fit (PMF) is a stage in a company's growth journey when the products or services it sells are substantial enough (without much spends on ads) to meet the needs of the market. It's one of the first milestones on the road to becoming a successful business, and once a company has achieved product-market fit, it can focus solely on product scaling and innovation.

With the recent rise in popularity and acceptance of the subscription model within SaaS, there has been more focus from VCs on distilling the observations of successful and not so successful startups into a checklist and framework that founders can follow. Many VCs run programmes focused on achieving PMF (Surge etc.). This has also led to a misconception among the *naive* founders that they just need to follow the suggested steps and they will be set for success. Nothing could be more wrong and they must understand that *what has worked for others may not work for them*.

Whether it's a B2B or B2C product, the hard truth of PMF remains:
1. **Product growth is sustainable**: At any point in time, the number of customers using your product will increase i.e. the churn rate (% of people who stop using your product out of total number of registered users) should always be lower than customer acquisition rate (sometimes **_organic_**)
2. **The total addressable market is large enough to support continued growth**: Consider a use case where you have already exhausted the total addressable market and have no room to grow. The market should provide opportunities for your product and any competitor that emerges later
3. **Decreasing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Increasing Lifetime Value (LTV)**: As the business scales, the share of revenue from existing users would exceed that from new users and the cost of acquisition should fall
4. **Increasing repeat user rates**: Repeat rates would increase with each successive product/feature launch, and word-of-mouth would drive a significant share of revenue
5. **Growth rate exceeds market growth rate:** You are growing much faster than the market and are gaining market share.

There is much more to PMF that cannot be covered in a short article and would be covered in a more detailed article at a later date. I would like to do a detailed article in the future on the do's and don'ts of PMF based on the frameworks + my thoughts, scale-up metrics and how to identify when you have achieved PMF.

### Technology Adoption Curve
#Technology-Adoption-Curve
 The technology adoption curve is based on the diffusion of innovations and the marketing chasm concept first developed by Lee James and Warren Schirtzinger and popularised by George A. Moore in his book *Crossing the Chasm*. It is based on the assumption that every technology goes through different stages in its life cycle and is received differently by different target groups.

<figure>
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/posts/Product-Adoption.png' | relative_url }}" 
         alt="Product Adoption Curve"

    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Product-Adoption Curve and the Chasm</figcaption>
</figure>

New products often fail to gain mainstream acceptance, despite initial good reception. There is a gap between the early adopters and the mainstream market. Mainstream companies look at the market to see who has already adopted your offering. If other big companies are already using the product, it will be adopted quickly. If not, it will fail. Few companies can cross the chasm. The framework suggests focusing on one audience at a time, and expanding the product as soon as an innovative company uses it to gain a competitive advantage.
