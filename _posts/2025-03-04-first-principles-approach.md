What if you could solve problems by ignoring assumptions and starting from the absolute basics? That’s the power of first principles thinking - a concept that’s been shaping human knowledge and creativity for millennia.

### What Is First Principles Thinking?

> When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
<cite>Arthur Conan Doyle</cite>

First principles thinking is a method of reasoning where you strip any idea or problem down to its most fundamental truths - facts so basic that they cannot be broken down or deduced from anything else. Instead of relying on what “everyone else does” or what seems to be the easiest assumption, you ask: _“What do I absolutely know to be true?”_

From these foundational truths, you then rebuild your understanding or solutions from scratch, often uncovering insights and possibilities that others miss.

This is not just a philosophical exercise - it’s a powerful mental model used in science, engineering, business, and entrepreneurship. People like Elon Musk and Ray Dalio have popularised this approach in recent years, but it’s a tradition stretching back over two thousand years.

First principles is one of the best ways to solve a problem through reasoning and logic. The basic idea behind first principles is to break down problem into the basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. It allows to learn to think for oneself, unlock creative potential, and move from linear to exponential outcomes. 

>I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.
<cite>Richard P. Feynman</cite>

Many teachers encourage students to accept information without questioning it, which can stifle curiosity and critical thinking in both individuals and society. First principles thinking breaking ideas down to their fundamentals and questioning assumptions requires humility and openness to being wrong. This mindset fosters deeper understanding and innovation.

### Historical origin of First Principles approach
  
Aristotle, a 4th-century BCE Greek philosopher, introduced first principles thinking, arguing that knowledge should be based on self-evident truths. He advocated for deductive reasoning and causality, shifting philosophy from myth to certain truths.

>In every systematic inquiry (*methodos*) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements.
<cite>Aristotle</cite>

Before Aristotle, philosophy and natural inquiry often relied on myth or tradition. His groundbreaking innovation was to insist that knowledge must be grounded in certain, undeniable truths, thereby laying the foundation for a more rigorous and systematic approach to understanding the world. His teacher Plato's Theory of Forms and early Indian and Chinese philosophies also explored foundational truths, making the quest for first principles a global tradition.

In the 17th century, René Descartes doubted everything until he found the undeniable truth, "*I think, therefore I am*," influencing modern science and rational thought. 

First principles thinking also thrived due to key historical shifts. The 15th-century printing press spread ideas, fostering debate. The Protestant Reformation encouraged questioning authority. The decline of medieval scholasticism opened new reasoning paths. Scientifically, Galileo and Newton applied first principles: Galileo challenged motion beliefs, while Newton formulated laws of motion and gravitation, revealing the universe's fundamental laws. These changes promoted critical thinking over blind acceptance.

Today, first principles thinking has moved far beyond philosophy and physics.
- **Elon Musk** uses it to rethink rocket design and electric car batteries, breaking problems down to raw materials and physics rather than industry norms.
- **Ray Dalio** applies it in finance, building systems from fundamental truths about economics and human behaviour.
- In education and design, innovators rebuild outdated systems around fundamental human needs and learning principles.

>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.
<cite>Aristotle</cite>

### Elon Musk and First Principles

Elon Musk has marketed himself well around applying first principles thinking to solve complex problems and drive innovation at companies like SpaceX and Tesla. In interviews, Musk explains:

>I think it’s important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy… *With first principles* you boil things down to the most fundamental truths…and then reason up from there [1]([https://fs.blog/first-principles/](https://fs.blog/first-principles/)). 

He credits his background in physics for this approach, stating:

>Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-s_3b5fRd8). 

By questioning assumptions such as the high cost of batteries or rockets, Musk has been able to innovate where others saw only limitations. He acknowledges this method is mentally demanding, noting, “*It takes a lot more mental energy,*” but believes it is essential for breakthrough progress.

This way of thinking isn’t purely technical, it’s deeply shaped by how a society encourages or discourages questioning, abstraction, and independence. Shane Parrish writes:

>Reasoning by first principles removes the impurity of assumptions and conventions. What remains is the essentials. It is one of the best mental models you can use to improve your thinking because the essentials allow you to see where reasoning by analogy might lead you stray.

### A Framework for Applying First Principles Through Socratic Questioning

Socratic questioning is a disciplined method of probing ideas through rigorous and repeated analysis. While not identical to first principles thinking, it serves a similar purpose: uncovering hidden assumptions, separating knowledge from belief, and clarifying reasoning. Socratic questioning systematically guides you through:

1. **Clarifying your thinking**: What exactly do I think? Why do I think this?
2. **Challenging assumptions**: How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?
3. **Seeking evidence**: What evidence supports this? What are my sources?
4. **Exploring alternative perspectives**: What might others think? How can I be sure I am correct?
5. **Examining consequences and implications**: What if I am wrong? What are the implications if I am?
6. **Reflecting on the original question**: Why did I ask this? Was my reasoning sound? What conclusions can I draw?

Socratic questioning is a powerful tool for critical thinking and is often used to break down complex problems, much like first principles thinking by systematically questioning every aspect of a belief or idea.

### The Perils of First Principles Thinking

While first principles thinking is powerful, it has real downsides when applied without care:

- **Reinventing the Wheel**: Starting from scratch can waste time solving problems that are already well-understood.
- **Overlooking Compliance**: Focusing purely on logic or efficiency can lead to missing legal, regulatory, or ethical requirements.
- **Requires Deep, Cross-Functional Knowledge**: Without broad domain expertise, it’s easy to oversimplify or miss critical factors.
- **Time-Intensive**: It often takes multiple iterations to frame the right problem — a challenge in fast-moving environments.

### Two More Mental Models That Help

- **Inversion:** Reverse the statement and evaluate whether the opposite could be true. If you can’t invalidate it, it may be more accurate than your assumption.
- **The 5 Whys:** Keep asking “why?” until you reach the root cause of a problem. It typically takes five iterations to get to the core.
